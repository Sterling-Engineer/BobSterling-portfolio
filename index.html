          </h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            I am a full stack developer who is fresh to the industry! The seed for development was first planted when I used to operate
            CNC lasers. With a thirst to learn via those around me as well as personal research, I learned not only how
            to operate a CNC laser, but how to minipulate and edit the code! 
            
            Those skills have played a key role in my growth and development in this field. I love to learn and research new things
            and with a strong work ethic I inspire to achieve great things in the world of development.
